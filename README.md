Roundcube Webmail Online Help
=============================

The repo contains the sources to generate the online help files documenting
the functions of Roundcube Webmail for end users.

The documentation is based on the [Sphinx Documentation Generator][sphinx] and
source files are written in reStructuredText (reST). The designated output format is HTML.


Generating Help Files
---------------------

First of all you need Python and [Sphinx][sphinx] installed. Grab the latest version of Sphinx with

	sudo easy_install -U Sphinx

This repo already contains the Sphinx project configuration and can be generated
right away with the following command:

	cd <this-repo-checkout-dir>
	make

The above example generates the English (US) online help files with English localization
for the navigation into the `_build/html/1.0/en_US` output directory.


Integrating Help for Plugins
----------------------------

For adding help contents from plugins to the table of contents, index and search pages you can
place doc files from plugins into the `<lang>/plugins` folder. All the resources for plugin docs need
to reside in a dedicated folder for the plugin which at least contains an `index.rst` with the TOC
of the plugin help. Here's an example folder structure:

    en_US/
        _plugins/
            <plugin-A>
                _static/screenshot.png
                index.rst
                moredoc.rst
            <plugin-B>
                index.rst


Translating
-----------

Volunteers who want to help translating the online help files into another language, please apply
for a team membership at our [Transifex project][transifex] and start translating online.

Using Transifex is really easy. Should you still have problems to understand one thing or the other,
the [Transifex Translator Guide][transifex-guide] might help you to get up to speed more quickly.

[![Translation Statistics][transifex-stats]][transifex]


Generating Translated Files
---------------------------

1. Pull translated `.po` files from Transifex, for example for the French language:

	```
	tx pull -f -l fr
	```

2. Compile `.mo` files:

	```
	sphinx-intl build
	```

3. Run Sphinx to build the localized docs by using the LANGUAGE parameter:

	```
	make LANGUAGE=fr html
	```

Skins Support
-------------

When using screen shots in the help documents, they should match the skin used in the webmail application.
Therefore, all `_static` directories containing images have subdirectories for skins (e.g. `larry`) and a
symlink `_skin` pointing to the skin you want to use for rendering the docs.

For easily changing these, have a look at the [setskin.sh](setskin.sh) utility script which updates all
`_skin` symlinks it finds in the project directory.
