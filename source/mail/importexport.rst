    Download Multiple Messages
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Multiple messages will be packed into a Zip file for downloading. Select individual messages
    in the :ref:`mail-messages-list` and then follow the instructions for downloading a single
    message. You need to unpack the downloaded .zip archive to access the individual message files.


    Export an Entire Folder
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    For archiving purposes all messages from a folder can be downloaded as .zip archive without
    first selecting them in the list.

    Switch to the folder you want to export and then select *Download folder* from the Folder actions
    menu behind the gear icon in the folders list footer.
