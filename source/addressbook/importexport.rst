Importing Contacts
------------------

Contacts can be imported into the Roundcube address books from `vCard <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard>`_
and `CSV <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ files.

1. Click the *Import* button from the top toolbar in the address book view to open the import wizard.
2. Then select the file to import from your computer's hard drive. Make sure it's either .vcf or .csv file.
3. Select which address book the contacts should be imported to.
   The checkbox let's you delete all contacts from the selected address book before importing.
   Be careful with this, the deletion cannot be undone!
4. Click the *Import* button to start the importing process.

The next screen will display the results of the import process. Click *Done* to get back to the address book view
and see the imported contacts.

Exporting Contacts
------------------

Contacts from Roundcube address books are exported in the `vCard <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard>`_ format only.

1. Select the address book or group you want to export.
2. Click the *Export* button in the top toolbar.
3. Choose where to save the exported .vcf file if prompted, otherwise check the "Downloads" folder on your computer
   for a file named "roundcube_contacts.vcf".

The *Export* toolbar button offers the following two options:

**Export all**
    That's the default action of the button and will pack all contacts currently listed into the vcard file.

**Export selected**
    If there's one or more contacts selected in the list (do this by holding down the *Shift* or *Ctrl* keys
    of your keyboard while clicking individual contacts), this option will generate a .vcf file with only the
    selected contacts.
