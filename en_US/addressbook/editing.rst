Select a contact from the contacts list and then press the *Edit contact* button
in the contact properties area on the right to start editing it.

In the upper part of the contact edit area are the name and organization fields as well
as the contact picture to be uploaded.

The lower part shows the same groups of contact properties as the :ref:`addressbook-contact-details`
structured with tabs and boxes.

Some properties have a type selector drop-down where you can select
what type of email address (e.g. home or work) this is. Remove a contact property
by either clearing the input field(s) or by clicking the *Delete* icon right next to it.

When done with editing, save your changes by clicking the *Save* button below the form.
Abort editing and discard your changes with the *Cancel* button.


Add more contact properties

Contacts have have a picture assigned which is also displayed in the email task of the application
if the sender of the message is saved with a picture in one of your address books.

right below the picture placeholder in the edit form. Then select an image on your computer using the file picker
dialog that appears. Once selected, the picture will be uploaded and shown immediately as a preview.

In order to remove the currently assigned picture from a contact, use the *Delete* button right below the
picture and save the contact to apply the changes.
