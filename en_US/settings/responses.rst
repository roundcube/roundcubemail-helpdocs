Canned Responses
*****************

This settings section lets you manage your personal boilerplates (aka "canned responses")
which are handy when replying to messages with :ref:`prepared responses<mail-compose-responses>`.


Edit Reponses
-------------

The middle pane displays a list of saved responses. Select one to see
its name and text in the form on the right. You can right away edit
both and save the changes by clicking the *Save* button.

.. container:: hint

    Hint: If the fields are not editable and there's no *Save* button below,
    this is a global response defined by the system administrator which
    cannot be edited.


Create a New Response
---------------------

Click the + icon in the responses list footer to create a new response.
Give it a name and enter the response text and finish with clicking the *Save*
button.


Delete a Reponse
----------------

The *Delete* button also located in the responses list footer will delete the currently selected
item after displaying a confirmation dialog.

The button may be grayed out for global responses managed by the system administrator.
