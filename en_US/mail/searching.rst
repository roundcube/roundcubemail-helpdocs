Message List Filters
--------------------

The drop-down menu next to the search box offers some pre-defined filters for quickly
reducing the messages listed to their status priority.

The filter rules selected here are applied in addition to the search term entered in the search box.
For example you can choose to only list unanswered messages from Paul by selecting the filter *Unanswered* and enter
"from:Paul" in the search box.
